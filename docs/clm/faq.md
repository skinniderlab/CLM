## How do I get sample datasets for CLM use?

Answer here.  

## What is the PubChem dataset and why do I need it?

[PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/downloads) is the freely accessible database of chemical information. 
PubChem mostly contains small molecules, but also larger molecules such as nucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, 
and chemically-modified macromolecules. The database holds information on chemical structures, identifiers, chemical and physical
properties, biological activities, patents, health, safety, toxicity data, and many others. 

As the PubChem database is most commonly used as a referenced for unidentified Mass Spectrometry signals, the `CLM` package 
utilizes it as a baseline to compare the performance of our model.
